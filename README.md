# DyslexiaScreeningPlatformDevelopment

The Qawaid4Dyslexia web survey is a series of six tests consisting of multiple choice, dictation oriented and as well as asked to upload hand-written text in Urdu. The web survey aims to test phonological awareness among users, and it assesses how accurately the user can access their mental word bank in connection to pictures they are shown and audio clips they hear. The survey questions cater to the reading/grade and education level of the user based on relevant information requested from them before the tests begin. The user pool is divided into three categories: children (Grades 1-5), teens (Grades 6-10), and adults (Grade 11 and beyond). The survey will collect data from both groups, people having Dyslexia (Diagnosed and Undiagnosed) and those who don't suffer from it, which will eventually help us in detection of dyslexia using writing patterns.
